...(q.cat && {cat:q.cat}),

In the context of a query object in JavaScript, the spread operator (...) is used to conditionally 
add properties to an object based on certain conditions. This can be very useful for constructing dynamic queries.
The expression ...(q.cat && { cat: q.cat }) works as follows:
q.cat: This checks if q.cat is truthy. If q.cat is not null, undefined, 0, false, NaN, or an empty string, 
it evaluates to true.
{ cat: q.cat }: If q.cat is truthy, this creates an object with the property cat set to the value of q.cat.
...(q.cat && { cat: q.cat }): If q.cat is truthy, the spread operator will spread the properties of { cat: q.cat }
 into the surrounding object. If q.cat is falsy, it will spread nothing (i.e., it effectively does nothing).
This allows for the conditional inclusion of the cat property in the query object.
